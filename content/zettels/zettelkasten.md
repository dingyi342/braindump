## The original Zettelkasten Method {#the-original-zettelkasten-method}

In the morning, Luhmann would take notes from his readings, penning
them down onto a piece of paper with a source inside.

In the evening, he would go through these notes and expand on them,
writing about how they impact his current studies.
