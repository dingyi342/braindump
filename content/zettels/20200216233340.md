The notion of reference prior is similar to that of a [non-informative
prior]({{< relref "20200216233133" >}}), but there are subtle differences. The uniform prior is arguably
non-informative, but is it not a good reference, because it is not
always invariant under reparamaterization.

Consider a reparameterization \\(\gamma = \log \theta\\), converting the
support of the parameter to the real line. The prior on \\(\gamma\\) is
given by:

\begin{equation}
  p\_\gamma (\gamma) = p(\theta)|J| = |J|
\end{equation}

where \\(|J| = \frac{d \theta}{d \gamma}\\) from the [Change of Variables Theorem]({{< relref "change_of_variables_theorem" >}}). Then

\begin{equation}
  p\_\gamma (\gamma) = e^\gamma, - \infty < \gamma < + \infty
\end{equation}

which is clearly not uniform. A prior that is invariant to
transformation, and easy to compute, is the [Jeffreys Prior]({{< relref "20200216233737" >}}).
