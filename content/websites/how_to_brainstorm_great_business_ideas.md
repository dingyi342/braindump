Executing the ideas require being strong in four main components:

1.  The problem (aka the market)
2.  The distribution channel to reach customers
3.  The monetization model
4.  The solution to the problem (aka the product or service)


## What makes a good problem? {#what-makes-a-good-problem}

1.  A good problem is one that many people have. A good number to aim
    for is at least hundred thousand.
2.  It is ideal if a group of people face the same problem (e.g. "developers")
3.  Problem is growing: more people will face it in time to come
4.  It's a good problem that people will pay money to solve

Always first search for a good problem. It may help to look at what
people are allready paying money for.


## Avoid Common Mistakes {#avoid-common-mistakes}

1.  Don't start with a solution in mind
2.  Don't rule out already solved problems
3.  Don't rule out high-value problems
4.  Have a customer in mind


## Don't Skip Distribution {#don-t-skip-distribution}

Knowing how to reach customers is important. There aren't many
channels to investigate, so go through them all. Some examples of
channels are:

-   SEO
-   press
-   content marketing
-   social media
-   sales
-   partnerships
-   ads


## Thinking about solutions {#thinking-about-solutions}

-   Solve problems in the opposite way of competitors
-   Solutions should be built on first principles
-   Product-market fit
    -   Stripe focus heavily on API design and documentation, because its
        market is developers
-   Product-distribution fit
