The authors analyzed various recent publications on recommendation
systems techniques, and found that these have:

1. Weak baselines
2. Establish weak methods as baselines
3. Are outperformed by simple, sometimes non-neural approaches

The simple approaches that work well include ItemKNN, a
collaborative-filtering approach that uses k-nearest neighbours and
item-item similarities:

\begin{equation}
  s_{ij} = \frac{r_i \dot r_j}{\lvert r_i \rvert \lvert r_j \rvert + h}
\end{equation}

To alleviate these issues:

1. Use appropriate evaluation methods
2. Evaluate on appropriate datasets (size is important)
3. Release reproducible code
