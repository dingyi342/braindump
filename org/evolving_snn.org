#+TITLE: Evolving Spiking Neural Networks

- tags :: [[file:spiking_neural_networks.org][§spiking_neural_networks]]

Early eSNN architectures use the [[file:leaky_integrate_and_fire.org][§leaky_integrate_and_fire]] model,
and rank-order encoding. eSNNs can be used for classification. Given
an input sample, the spike train is propagated through the SNN,
resulting in the firing of output neurons. If no output neuron is
activated, the classification result is undetermined. If one or more
output neurons emit a spike, the label of the neuron with the shortest
response time represents the classification result.

* Training an eSNN

For each class label an individual repository is evolved. A new output
neuron is created and fully connected to the previous layer of
neurons. Input spikes are propagated through the network, and the
weight vector for the neuron is computed, along with its firing
threshold. This weight vector is compared to existing neurons in the
repository. If neurons are too similar (e.g. small Euclidean distance
between weight vectors), they are merged.
