SimCLR is a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual
representations.

* Key Contributions
- Composition of data augmentation to form positive pairs
- introduce a learnable nonlinear transformation between the
  representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the
  quality of the learned representations
- Contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more
  training steps compared to supervised learning

* Data Augmentation
 A stochastic data augmentation module is introduced to produce two
 correlated views of the same example, denoted $\tilde{x}_i$ and
 $\tilde{x}_j$, which is considered a positive pair. Some of these
 augmentations include:

- random cropping
- random color distortions
- random Gaussian blur

A neural network encoder $f(\cdot)$ extracts representation vectors
from augmented data examples.

A small network projection head $g(\cdot)$ maps representations to the
space where contrastive loss is applied. 

The loss function (normalized temperature-scaled cross entropy loss)
is applied on the output of $g(\cdot)$.

A minibatch of N examples is sampled, resulting in $2N$ data-points.
The other 2(N-1) augmented examples within the minibatch is used as
negative examples.

\begin{equation}
\ell_{i, j}=-\log \frac{\exp \left(\operatorname{sim}\left(\boldsymbol{z}_{i}, \boldsymbol{z}_{j}\right) / \tau\right)}{\sum_{k=1}^{2 N} \mathbb{1}_{[k \neq i]} \exp \left(\operatorname{sim}\left(\boldsymbol{z}_{i}, \boldsymbol{z}_{k}\right) / \tau\right)}
\end{equation}

* The Importance of the Projection Head

It is conjectured that the projection head $g(\cdot)$ is important due
to loss of information induced by the contrastive loss. $z = g(h)$ is
trained to be invariant to the data transformation. Thus $g$ can
remove information that may be useful for the downstream task, such as
color or orientation of objects.
