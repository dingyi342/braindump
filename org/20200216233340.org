#+TITLE: Reference Prior

The notion of reference prior is similar to that of a [[file:20200216233133.org][non-informative
prior]], but there are subtle differences. The uniform prior is arguably
non-informative, but is it not a good reference, because it is not
always invariant under reparamaterization.

Consider a reparameterization $\gamma = \log \theta$, converting the
support of the parameter to the real line. The prior on $\gamma$ is
given by:

\begin{equation}
  p_\gamma (\gamma) = p(\theta)|J| = |J|
\end{equation}

where $|J| = \frac{d \theta}{d \gamma}$ from the [[file:change_of_variables_theorem.org][Change of Variables Theorem]]. Then

\begin{equation}
  p_\gamma (\gamma) = e^\gamma, - \infty < \gamma < + \infty
\end{equation}

which is clearly not uniform. A prior that is invariant to
transformation, and easy to compute, is the [[file:20200216233737.org][Jeffreys Prior]].
